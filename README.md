# Medical Chatbot (POC)
This is a proof of concept (POC) Chatbot that uses ML (Machine Learning) modules such as Tensorflow and Keras to train and provide medical data and analysis. This Chatbot provided with sufficient data in data.json could provide astronishing results but for now the data is sufficient to proove the concept of Medical/Pharma Chatbots in everyday life.

# Install Requirements
